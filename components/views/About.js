  <p id="aboutMe">
    I am currently in a Full Stack Development bootcamp and will be looking for
    my next opportunity in software development to begin toward the end of
    November 2023. In the meantime, I am continuing to build upon my knowledge
    of Javascript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, NoSQL and a handful of other
    tools/languages to build a web app that tracks the stock trades and
    performance of our representatives in congress. My fascination with coding
    grew from my recent experience selling a SaaS for Cloud Infrastructure and
    Application monitoring at Datadog. While I was working at Datadog I learned
    to collaborate with engineers to make sense of disparate systems and
    troubleshoot convoluted tech stacks as their businesses and applications
    scaled. Whether we would be looking to help shed light on how their current
    data orchestration was affecting their containers, or help them understand
    how users were navigating the front-end of their web applications, my job
    was to be a well informed trusted advisor on best practices in tech at the
    time. This helped me understand how one developerâ€™s commits can affect the
    tech stack writ large whether it be through creating inefficient code that
    will cost more or creating an architecture with security vulnerabilities out
    of the gate.
