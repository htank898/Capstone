      Lobbying, in its current form, undermines democracy by granting undue
      power to corporations while sidelining the interests of voters. Wealthy
      corporations wield influence through financial resources, shaping policies
      that prioritize profits over the public good. The revolving door between
      government and lobbying firms blurs the line between public service and
      corporate interests. The secretive nature of lobbying hides these
      influences from voters, eroding transparency and accountability. To
      protect the democratic process, urgent measures are needed to enhance
      transparency, impose stricter regulations, and prioritize policies that
      prioritize the welfare of the people over corporate gains.
